To run this app locally 

clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhmedSama/ML-predict-iris-type.git
```
cd to ML-predict-iris-type directory
```bash
cd ML-predict-iris-type
```
- ###  setup the server
cd to server directory and install python requirements
> I recommend installing everything in python virtual environment so if you want, first cd to server dir and run `python -m venv env` to make a virtual environment and then activate it using `env\Scripts\activate` on windows or `source env/bin/activate` on Unix or MacOS

and follow the other steps

```bash
cd server
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
it will may take a while to install everything


run the server
```bash
python app.py
```
now the server will run in the terminal on port `5000`
- ###  setup the client
open a new terminal and cd to client directory and run npm install
```bash
cd client
npm install
```
run the app
```bash
npm start
```

once it successfully running go to ```localhost:3000``` in your browser
